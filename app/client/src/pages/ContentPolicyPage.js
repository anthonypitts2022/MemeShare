    MemeSharer Content Policy
    MemeSharer is a platform for communities to discuss, connect, and share in an open environment, home to some of the most authentic content anywhere online. The nature of this content might be funny, serious, offensive, or anywhere in between. While participating, itâ€™s important to keep in mind this value above all others: show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy MemeSharer for what it is.

    Unwelcome content
    While MemeSharer generally provides a lot of leeway in what content is acceptable, here are some guidelines for content that is not. Please keep in mind the spirit in which these were written, and know that looking for loopholes is a waste of time.

    Content is prohibited if it

    Is illegal
    Is involuntary pornography
    Is sexual or suggestive content involving minors
    Encourages or incites violence
    Threatens, harasses, or bullies or encourages others to do so
    Is personal and confidential information
    Impersonates someone in a misleading or deceptive manner
    Uses MemeSharer to solicit or facilitate any transaction or gift involving certain goods and services
    Is spam
    Prohibited behavior
    In addition to not submitting unwelcome content, the following behaviors are prohibited on MemeSharer

    Asking for votes or engaging in vote manipulation
    Breaking MemeSharer or doing anything that interferes with normal use of MemeSharer
    Creating multiple accounts to evade punishment or avoid restrictions
    NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content
    Content that contains nudity, pornography, or profanity, which a reasonable viewer may not want to be seen accessing in a public or formal setting such as in a workplace should be tagged as NSFW. This tag can be applied to individual pieces of content or to entire communities.

    Enforcement
    We have a variety of ways of enforcing our rules, including, but not limited to

    Asking you nicely to knock it off
    Asking you less nicely
    Temporary or permanent suspension of accounts
    Removal of privileges from, or adding restrictions to, accounts
    Adding restrictions to MemeSharer communities, such as adding NSFW tags or Quarantining
    Removal of content
    Banning of MemeSharer communities
    Moderation within communities
    Individual communities on MemeSharer may have their own rules in addition to ours and their own moderators to enforce them. MemeSharer provides tools to aid moderators, but does not prescribe their usage.
